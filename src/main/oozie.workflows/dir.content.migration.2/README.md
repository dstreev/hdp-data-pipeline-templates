# File Migration

This workflow is used to move (a) file(s) from one directory in HDFS to another.  This is a common load scenario when source files are presented in one directory and then need to be cleared to another for processing.

This is a copy of the dir.content.migration with a different set of variable names to support a second move in sub workflow.
